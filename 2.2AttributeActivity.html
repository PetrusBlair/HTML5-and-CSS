    <li>Find the list of supported attributes for the &lt;area&gt; tag. The elements that support the area attribute are: <strong>alt, coords, download, href, hreflang, media, ping, rel, shape, and target. </strong>  </li>
    <li>Create two paragraphs with the same id and run your code in a CodePen. What happens? We know the value of the id attribute must be unique, so why does it behave the way it does? Run your code through the W3C Markup Validator. Does it throw an error?</li>

  <p id="para1">The quality of mercy is not strained;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath.</p>
  <p id="para1">It is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
‘T is mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown:
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God’s
When mercy seasons justice. </p>
