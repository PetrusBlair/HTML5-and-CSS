  <h1>Attibute Activity</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Find the list of supported attributes for the &lt;area&gt; tag. The elements that support the area attribute are: <strong>alt, coords, download, href, hreflang, media, ping, rel, shape, and target. </strong>  </li>
    <li>Create two paragraphs with the same id and run your code in a CodePen. What happens? I was using Jsbin so nothing happened. When I uploaded the code to <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea">https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea</a> I got an error. </li>
    <li>Does an attribute called src exist? <strong>Yes an attribute called src exists. It is used as the address for a URL.</strong>   What is the purpose of this attribute and what are the elements it can be applied to? <strong> It can be used in the following elements: audio, embed, iframe, img, input, script, source, track and video. </strong> </li>
    <li>Create an ordered list starting with the number 11. Then, reverse the list. Give it the following title (when you hover your mouse, it should display the title as a tooltip): 'Activity List'.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Two paragraphs with matching id attributes.</h2>
  <p id="para1">The quality of mercy is not strained;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath.</p>
  <p id="para1">It is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
‘T is mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown:
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God’s
When mercy seasons justice. </p>
