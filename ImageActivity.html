  <h2>Part One: Day in the Life of an Egyptian Scribe</h2>   
  <p>The beginning of the teaching which the man of Tjel named Dua-Khety made for his son named Pepy, while he sailed southwards to the Residence to place him in the school of writings among the children of the magistrates, the most eminent men of the Residence. </p>
  <p> As for a scribe in any office in the Residence, he will not suffer want in it. When he fulfills the bidding of another, he does not come forth satisfied. I do not see an office to be compared with it, to which this maxim could relate. I shall make you love books more than your mother, and I shall place their excellence before you. It is greater than any office. There is nothing like it on earth. When he began to become sturdy but was still a child, he was greeted (respectfully). When he was sent to carry out a task, before he returned he was dressed in adult garments.</p>

  <h2>Part Three: Specific Kinds of Images on a website.</h2>   
    <p>The following examples are drawn from <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/">https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/</a></a></p>
    <ol>
    <li>Informative Images: Used to convey a concept. In this case the image helps to convey the meaning of the idea. Here is my happy face. <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/129/smiling-face-with-open-mouth-and-smiling-eyes_1f604.png" alt="Happy face emoji" title="A happy face emoji" width="20px"> </li>
    <li>Decorative image: These are the kinds of images that are purely decorative and should have a null alt text. In this example for the from the Museum of Fine Arts Boston the classic image of Winne the Pooh is purely decorative. You can see the original on this <a href="https://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/winnie-the-pooh">page</a>. <br><br> 
      <img src="https://mfas3.s3.amazonaws.com/styles/grid-2_thumbnail_retina/s3/4x3_10_0.jpg" alt="" width="100px"> </li>
    <li>Images of text: Usually, images of text should not be used unless, they cannot be accomplished another way. Most text effects can be done through fonts and CSS3 rather than images. For instance, this hieroglyphic inscription from the pyramid of Unis could be written with a font if a suitable Ancient Egyptian unicode font was available. Since one is not, than an image is preferable. You can see the original on <a href="https://www.pyramidtextsonline.com/plate32.html">https://www.pyramidtextsonline.com/plate32.html</a><br><br><img src="https://www.pyramidtextsonline.com/Piankoff/P32.jpg" alt="photo of East Wall Lower Register" title="photo of the East Wall Lower Register in the pyramid of Unis" width="200px"></li>
